One of the things that we will enjoy is the adaptability of the group. I mentioned last week that Timo, Kai Havertz and Christian Pulisic can all play anywhere along the front line and to some degree behind that line as well. That is also the case in other areas too. It may well be that the last five minutes were quietly amongst the most important tactically of the whole match, in terms of the future of the club.
