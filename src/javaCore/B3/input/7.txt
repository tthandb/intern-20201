Chelsea fans used to call their old ground ‘Three Point Lane’, but our maiden bow at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last December was something of a landmark too.

For starters, it was a wonderful 2-0 victory, Willian’s brace making the Blues the fourth team to hit a 100 Premier League goals against the same opponent. The others were Arsenal, Manchester United – both against Everton – and Liverpool against Newcastle.

The win also marked the first time in any competition Jose Mourinho had lost a home game against a team he had previously managed. On top of that, the Blues became the first team to beat Spurs in all three of their home stadiums in the Premier League.
