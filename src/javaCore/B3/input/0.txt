There is no question about the ability of that Liverpool frontline to score goals, as Leeds United found out last week, but the defence is looking a lot less watertight over the last few months. They shipped three goals or more against us, Man City, Atletico Madrid, Watford and then Leeds United, so teams are beginning to work out where the cracks are. It is partly down to the way they play, both full-backs flying forward at the same time, leaving the two centre-backs exposed now and again. However if they score as freely as they do, the strikers can usually dig them out of trouble.
