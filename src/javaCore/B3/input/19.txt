I digress. Jorginho went off, Cesar Azpilicueta sprinted on and Reece James languidly stepped into midfield and looked like he owned the area within seconds. It is not stylish to say it with the brilliance of Trent Alexander-Arnold at Liverpool, but the Reds’ full-back is not a shoo-in to keep that place for England while James is still playing at right full-back. Reece could however be a central midfield colossus for the club in the months and years to come and if Gareth Southgate wants, maybe that is how he eventually fits both into the Three Lions’ set-up together.
