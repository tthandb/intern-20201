The Premier League have announced that Manchester United will return to competitive action on Friday 19 June, when they travel to face Tottenham Hotspur behind closed doors. The match will mark the end of an unprecedented three-month suspension of action owing to the coronavirus pandemic. It is expected to go ahead in spite of the news that one person associated with Spurs tested positive for COVID-19 in the latest round of Premier League testing.
United will play their first home game after the interval on Wednesday 24 June, when they play host to the high-flying Sheffield United. The Reds will then take on Norwich City in their FA Cup quarterfinal tie at Carrow Road on Saturday 27 June, before travelling to take on struggling Brighton the following Tuesday 30 June.
