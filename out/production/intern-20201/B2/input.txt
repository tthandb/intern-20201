Simulation is a common practice for the
performance evaluation and capacity planning of
Web-based systems. Indeed, the complexity of
current Web architectures often makes analytical
solutions of the related mathematical models
infeasible. In this paper we present CWebSim: a
simulation framework conceived for cluster-based
Web services. These architectures are frequently
used in practice: they are built on pools of server
nodes, also known as Web farms/clusters, that are
interconnected by a LAN with the goal of sharing
the load of incoming requests. Many alternatives
exist and CWebSim can be used to evaluate most of
them, especially those acting at the higher levels,
that is, application protocols, server-level caching,
file systems. Nevertheless, CWebSim remains a
detailed simulation model of a Web cluster,
encompassing the main issues about the hardware,
the operating system and the application layers, such
as internal network and disk transfers, overheads due
to request dispatching and processing. Special
attention has been posed also to the workload model
that reproduces a Web environment: in the case of
the synthetic workload, realistic distributions for
document sizes and requests are adopted, whereas
the trace-based method has the appreciable feature
of preserving the time dependencies. The CWebSim
simulation framework can be customized into
several Web service architectures, thanks to its
modular design which allows the combinations of a
broad variety of technical features, such as the
adoption of different request dispatching policies
and internal network hardware. By redefining the
node functions and interconnections, complex
proxy-caching systems or multi-tier architectures for
e-commerce services can be easily simulated.
