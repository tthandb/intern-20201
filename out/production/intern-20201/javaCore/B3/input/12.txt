Such is football these days, of course. But suffice it to say that in an ideal world, one would probably prefer to face a side as strong as Liverpool with 11 men on the pitch for at least, say, 75 minutes, and not have to sub off one of your clubâ€™s big signings in the interval to compensate for the dismissal of half your central defence. Alas, though, as we all know, this is not an ideal world, and last Sunday we suffered a little for that. But no lasting damage, clearly.
