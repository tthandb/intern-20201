Chelsea are clearly an early work in progress in comparison and may well be for a little while with all the new signings, which is not to say the team will be anything less than competitive against anyone in the Premier League on any particular day. The game against Brighton gave plenty of clues but fewer concrete answers. Timo Werner is going to be loved by all of us. Even if you are nothing more than an average player and you put in that sort of work rate, real fans will warm to you, because you clearly care. But if you happen to be talented, lightning fast and a natural goalscorer too, you could quickly become a cult figure at the club.
