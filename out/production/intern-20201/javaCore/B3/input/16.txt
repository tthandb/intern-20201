There were flashes of understanding between the newbies and the current team, but in reality that takes a little while to gel fully. Yes, I know they are top footballers and can play together perfectly well, but it is that extra bit on top that makes the difference. Things like understanding where the strengths and preferences of all your new team-mates are, where they want the ball and what are their specific favourite skills. Timo Werner is probably aware that Reece James is really good at crossing from the right-hand side, but does he know yet that Reece is actually sensational in that area when he is in mid-season form? He will get to know soon enough.
