Jorginho went off with tiredness having dominated the previous 20 minutes. He killed the game stone dead with his ability to take and keep possession anywhere, particularly deep, sometimes in our own penalty box. His penalty up the other end was as ever fabulous, we almost take that for granted now, but there are those of us who watch him play like that and feel he would probably be chosen to start by any team on the planet. His interception for the first goal was also pure class, understanding what his opponent was thinking of doing, even before he did.
