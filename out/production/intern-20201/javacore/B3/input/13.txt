Having more or less adapted to the new reality, we now have to adapt to the new new reality, one of the effects of which will presumably be to all but eliminate the 8.15 kick-off. Next Monday night’s televised Premier League game between Liverpool and Arsenal has already been shifted to start at 8.00, which makes sense because otherwise, with the new protocol on 10.00pm pub closures, people would have been getting chucked out in the 86th-minute or so, which wouldn’t be ideal.
